# Python-Interpreter-for-TI-84-Plus-CE
This is a Python (similarly to Python 3) Interpreter for the TI 84 CE, written in ICE.

This interpreter is being worked on, so don't expect a lot right now. However, the Interpreter does read your code.
The only problem is the only command I added: print("[text]") and, to enter a next line, type '/n'.
I will need help on this, that'd be appreciated! :)

Thanks for trying it out though!
